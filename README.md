[Aqua Book](https://doc.fluence.dev/aqua-book/)
> Fluence is an open protocol and a framework for internet or private cloud applications. Fluence provides a peer-to-peer development stack so that you can create applications free of proprietary cloud platforms, centralized APIs, and untrustworthy third-parties.
> At the core of Fluence is the open-source language Aqua that allows for the programming of peer-to-peer scenarios separately from the computations on peers.
